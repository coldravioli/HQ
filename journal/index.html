            Webpages are living and breathing creatures. Whether created by hand or machine, they evolve and change over time. Handmade webpages in particular, show the greatest transformations, influenced by the continuous growth of knowledge, skill, and purpose of their creators. 
        </p><p>
            I'm a big believer in how knowledge is both power and privilege. After the reading, I thought about this statement even more. A website starts as a reflection of what you know in the moment, and as you develop and strengthen your knowledge, you gain the ability to refine and improve it. 
        </p><p>  
            Handmade websites have their creator's mark or signature on them forever, a quality that's rarely seen or found in the computer generated websites that we have today. Our "frames" of how we view these websites are continuously changing: styles become outdated, technology gets... better (?), and all that matters is growth. Frustrating.

            What is technology? What deems something "technologically advanced"... and does it require electricity?
        </p><p>
            In a way, I agree that the word 'technology' has become a buzzword, and that it's used to glorify progress at any cost. In addition, I agree with her statement about "soft technologies". They may even be more valuable than the "flashy innovations" of the modern industry. Technology is all the tools and techniques created by man. I like the 'fluidity' of the term and would like to explore this concept.

        <p>
            An "Experimental web publishing project", in which there's a plethora of information and written content. Attacked like a virus, I was bombarded with 50+ messages and flashing buttons. In that moment, I've never once before yearned for a subway surfers edit below the screen. My patience was stretched incredibly thin. <b>Attention can be exchanged, and can be used like a currency</b>.

            - Mindy Seu</h2>
        <p>
            The web is living because it can die, therefore things are time sensitive. Content disappears and links break, and all that remains is outdated remnants. 
        </p><p>
            "Tools shape the way we behave". 
        </p><p> 
            Pushing Seu's statement even further, I would like to think that <b>tools shape how we advance</b>. This reading made me think about the history of technology, specifically in 8-bit design. Early tools and limitations of technology constrained creativity and pushed developers to think outside of the box. They were able to work under technological constraints and create some of the most iconic and influential games / visuals we know today. 
        </p><p>
            8-bit design didn't just shape behavior, it catalyzed innovation. Developers took these limitations, and gave themselves a challenge. When new versions of the gaming consoles came into the light, these limitations became obsolete. Tools evolved and became more 'sophisticated', and contraints diminished. 
        </p><p>
            I find it really sad how the ingenuity of 8-bit design (and web development) is often, if not entirely, forgotten. The creativity that was once born out of necessity and limitations is overshadowed by today's AI bots and technological "antichrists". While it's true that modern advancements have made development easier, they often lack the soul and hard work of a dedicated developer.

            The World Wide Web consumes 10% of all global electricity production, and is a number that is continously increasing. I think it's quite funny that people have no idea what happens to their data when they put it into the magical 'Cloud'. It's ironic how detached in general we've become with the physical impact of our digital actions. We scroll endlessly, upload photos, and save everything without considering the energy intensive servers working in massive data centers. 
        </p><p>
            It's frustrating that there's little transparency about where our data is going when it enters this 'Cloud' or endless vat of storage. Who really owns it, and how safe is it actually? I wonder how the future of technology will handle the exponential growth of data and family pictures. Will there be new innovative, environmentally friendly options? Or will convenience outweigh consequence?

            "Something must change, and to many of us, it seems that a whole new path is necessary. Can we create one without completely disconnecting? I am here to offer a very loud and exasperated, “I don't know.”"
        </p><p>
            I really resonated with the statement, "the web is a boundless and shared estate, and we only later learned how to commercialize it.". The tools given to us by developers, which are presumed to be designed to the user's habits and likes, ultimately serve a different purpose. At the core, the main objective of big corporations and people who promote products is growth and wealth, often at the expense of genuine connection. 
        </p><p>
            I see ads every day on social media platforms from celebrities, and occasionally from someone that I follow. It's actually kinda frightening. I understand that it's free, widespread publicity, but I don't care about your Dyson Hair Wrap. I don't care about what foundation works the 'best'. The "Do Not Recommend" buttons are getting harder to find, and the "#ad" is beginning to fade. I want my ad-less feed back. I want a marketplace of ideas, rather than a marketplace of products.

            A website can be a plethora of things. Whether it's an online shop, wiki site, or even a Spotify music generator, all are considered websites. There is no limit to what a website can be, making it a living, growing organism.  
        </p><p>

            What will this website itself look like in one or two years? Or will it still look the same? 
        </p><p>
            Similar to what I've written for "A Handmade Web", I love the idea of how just creating changes how you handle a challenge, in whether speed, function, or general ideation. By putting forth an outcome (or the first step), it will lead to further 'momentum' or progress. The web grows as we do, changing through our attempts to improve and reimagine it.
